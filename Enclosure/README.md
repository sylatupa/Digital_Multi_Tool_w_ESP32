# The Enclosure for the Digital_Multi_Tool_w_ESP32 -- a lasercut, stacked sandwhich style, enclosure with simple and adaptable shapes and sizes. 

# What is it?

# Why do it?

All the SVG paths were draw in Inkscape. Because Inkscape prints by converting to raster, the files were brought into Corel Draw. 
There was a lot of conversion mistakes and much of my work had to be redone--but the general shapes and size were all figured out.
There are around 6 shapes, mix and matched they are used to create various enclosures. 
 
The enclosures held long and thin TTGO brand ESP32's. It made sense to try and match the scale of the boards in length and width.

The aesthetic of the enclosure was first seen with a raspberry pi. 

The reasons for the design decisions are the following:

I didnt have enough time to do multiple iterations but I knew that the first cut wouldn't be perfect. 

* The purpose of the Digital Multi tool is the following:
** To design an an enclosure for ESP32 that can speed up the design, development, implement, and iterate lifecycle. The lazer cut patterns can be downloaded and slighly adapted for future uses cases. This bridges the gap between prototyping on a breadboard to prototyping for more embedded applications.
