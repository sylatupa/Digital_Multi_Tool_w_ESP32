# The Enclosure for the Digital_Multi_Tool_w_ESP32 -- a lasercut, stacked sandwhich style, enclosure with simple and adaptable shapes and sizes. 

# What is it?
The laser cut acrylic and birch wood are stacked together to form an enclosure for electronic devices of upto 3cm x 15cm. Using different layer combinations for different IOT applications, the content space of the enclosure adapts to the sensors and interface modules placed inside.

The electronics used in this project are TTGO brand ESP32 development boards that range from 2.5cm x 6cm to 3cm x 9cm in widht and height. The bigger board commonly has a built battery and OLED screen. All boards have some button, flash storage, or charging port that sticks off the sides; these buttons and ports are accessed through side of the enclosure by intentional gaps in the acrylics layers. 

The 7 types of laser cut enclosure layers and the one Sensor Slide

'Sensor Slide' is laser cut 3cmx3cm clear acrylic. The holes through the slide accepts 3mm and 2.5mm standoffs. The holes are spaced so to accept many common sensor modules

All the SVG paths were draw in Inkscape. Because Inkscape prints by converting to raster, the files were brought into Corel Draw. 
There was a lot of conversion mistakes and much of my work had to be redone--but the general shapes and size were all figured out.
There are around 6 shapes, mix and matched they are used to create various enclosures. 
 
The enclosures held long and thin TTGO brand ESP32's. It made sense to try and match the scale of the boards in length and width.

The aesthetic of the enclosure was first seen with a raspberry pi. 

The reasons for the design decisions are the following:

I didnt have enough time to do multiple iterations but I knew that the first cut wouldn't be perfect. 

* The purpose of the Digital Multi tool is the following:
** To design an an enclosure for ESP32 that can speed up the design, development, implement, and iterate lifecycle. The lazer cut patterns can be downloaded and slighly adapted for future uses cases. This bridges the gap between prototyping on a breadboard to prototyping for more embedded applications.
