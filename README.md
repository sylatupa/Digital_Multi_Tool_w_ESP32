Software:

IOT Network that provides a routing of data between the IOT devices
UDP connection when no MQTT broker available
OFFLINE -- a standard Publisher Subscriber software paradigm so that the modules on the device can share the data 
Modules and software applications have a configuration file, leading to ‘code reuse’ for certain modules, like:
Neopixels of varying length, quantity of strips and the pins that they’re on.
Swapping/Adding analog sensors, or digital sensors
TouchPads of varying quantity.

Enclosure:
Laser cut acrylic
Multiple Sizes so that each box can have a varying number of hardware modules
Dupont connectors--a lot less soldering



Hardware / Hardware Modules:
Accelerometer
Neopixels of varying sizes
Amplified Microphone
Haptic feedback
OLED display

Reporting:
GITHUB Project
