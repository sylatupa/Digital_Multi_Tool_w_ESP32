speed
acceleration rate of change of velocity
curvature  and cross product
jerkyness

velocity
x(t) = x(t-1)

speed is a magnitutde of velocity

canceling like this can introduce noise.

smoothing as parameter


t f f   (trigger float float)

to an expression that does velocity

velocity is =  t2-t1

accelereation =  load v2 - v1

cross product patch (the top term of the curvature functions)

now magnitude (the bottom term of the Curvature functions)
